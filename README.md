# Tic-Tac-Toe
A project that utilizes the CSS Grid Layout scheme. A main board div is created to hold the 9 cells which will contain the X or O. The top, left, right and bottom borders are removed to give the main board a look of the classic tic tac toe layout. The player with X starts the game always. On hovering over an empty cell, depending on whose turn it is, a translucent X or O is displayed in that cell.

On clicking on the empty cell either an orange X or a green O is fixed into the cell and accordingly the player turns switch.

At the end of the game, a translucent white background is displayed over the game board with either a winning message (X’s win or O’s win) or draw message and a restart button also appears. The logic for winning includes identifying winning combinations of rows, columns or diagonals which is done in JavaScript. If none of the winning combinations are matched, then a draw is decided. On clicking the restart button the board is cleared and the game starts all over again.
